Open Reviews 
##########

This folder contains the open reviews for those papers participating in the open reviewing process. All papers received at least two reviews, but not all reviewers agreed to participate in the open reviewing process. Only the reviews from those who have explicitly agreed on participating have been included. 

Reviews have been posted anonymously, but if any of the reviewers want to add their name, they are free to do so (contact any of the chairs or send a pull request).

Authors, if you want to answer to your reviewers, just for the repository and add your comments!
